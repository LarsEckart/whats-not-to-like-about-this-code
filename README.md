Whatâ€™s Not To Like About This Code?
===================================

Clarify what problem you see in the code, rather than how you would improve it.


Practical Task
===================================

Ronnie prides himself on being a quick developer and has been able to get out the first version
of our software in record time. But Ronnie has left to go to a better paying job.
Our stakeholders are getting anxious that they've not seen any new features for quite some time now.
They miss Ronnie's productivity.

Many customers would prefer to get notified by SMS, or even through this new messenger app.

We'd like you to help us with

* writing tests so that any new developer can understand how the system is behaving and if it still works,
* fix any bugs/faults you encounter, refactoring is also encouraged,
* implement the missing functionality:
  sending SMS in case we not only have an email address but also have a phone number associated with a delivery.


The feature after that, notifications through the new messenger app, will be handled by our developer then.
